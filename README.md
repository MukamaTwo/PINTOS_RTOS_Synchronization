# PINTOS_RTOS_Synchronization
Synchronization in  real operating systems, Pintos.

This project is two parts:

1. Enhancement of synchronization implementations to prevent busy-waiting (a thread waiting until another thread/process stops it) and making an alternative implementation of the sleep function.
2. Deal with the synchronization problems that occur when scheduling jobs that send and receive data through a common bus for an external hardware accelerator (e.g. GPU, co-processor).
